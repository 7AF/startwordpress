Start WordPress
========

####A Theme for Learning WordPress####

You know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can make beautiful websites. Maybe you’ve heard about WordPress, but aren’t entirely sure how to implement it, or why you might need it. Maybe a client asked for WordPress, but you’re not really familiar with it. Maybe you’ve worked with it before, but don’t know how to make your own theme from scratch. Whatever the case, this article is for you.

Read the article on [Developing a Wordpress Theme from Scratch](http://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/).

### Prerequisites

All you need to start is a website. Any website will do. You don’t need to know any PHP, or have any prior experience with WordPress. Your website can be custom, or built on Bootstrap/some other framework.

You do need to know how to set up a local server environment. Fortunately, if you don’t know how, I wrote a short, sweet article about getting set up with one. [It will only take a few minutes, so go ahead and do that first.](http://www.taniarascia.com/local-environment/)
